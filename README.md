# GathererMod
GathererMod adds a new character for Slay The Spire, The Gatherer. Contains 75 cards and 8 relics, excluding token cards generated by others.

The main focus of The Gatherer is the Potion. She has a potion Sack which can hold 3 "lesser" potions. The contents of the sack are gone at the end of each combat, so it's better to use them all. Especially when there are powers that care about using potions.

Other mechanics: Cards care about 2+ Cost cards, Unique cards, on-obtain effect card

* Requires ModTheSpire and BaseMod.
* Also you need StSLib(https://github.com/kiooeht/StSLib/releases) to play this mod!

## Gameplay
Will add later with screens shots.

## Current State and Goal
GathererMod is currently at beta. All cards are implemented.
Now I'm wishing for a few more balance pass and most importantly, custom in-game animation before going version 1.0.

- Implemented Cards: 75/75
- Implemented Relics: 7/8
- Implemented Events: 1

All arts are not final, except for the character select screen art drawn by MappyTheKat.

As a goal, The Gatherer will have similar quality as official characters. The power level of cards is going to be similar, though I can accept if she is a little bit weaker than other characters.

## Special Thanks To
- Devs of Slay The Spire, BaseMod and ModTheSpire
- #unsupported-modding in Slay the Spire discord is fun.

## License
- All code is in MIT license.
- Arts are complicated. The character select screen art is drawn by MappyTheKat, so you need to ask him before using it(or, if you ask me, I'll forward to him). Some arts are from Slay the Spire base game or slightly altered of it, which feels strange for me to license. Similar for googled images. Arts made by me, usually with simple shapes, are free to use. If you're unsure about where art was from, feel free to contact me.
