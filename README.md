# GathererMod
A Slay the Spire mod; adds a character called The Gatherer

GathererMod Adds a new character for Slay The Spire, The Gatherer. 75 new cards as usual, excluding special token cards which are generated by others.

The primary focus of The Gatherer is the Potion. She has a potion sack which can hold 3 "lesser" potions. The contents of the sack are gone at the end of each combat, so it's better to use them all. Especially when there are powers that care about using potions. There are other mechanics as well, like Collector cards which care about unique cards in your deck, or cards with on-gain effects.

## Current State and Goal
GathererMod is at an early development stage. Cards are not implemented fully, and they are going to change vastly.
Implemented Cards: 33/75
Implemented Relics: 3/7
Implemented Events: 0
All arts are not final, regardless of having BETA in its image or not. I'll try to make arts after finishing all the contents.

As a goal, The Gatherer will have similar quality as official characters. The power level of cards is going to be similar, though I can accept if she is a little bit harder than other characters.
