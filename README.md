# GathererMod
GathererMod adds a new character for Slay The Spire, The Gatherer. Contains 75 cards and 8 relics, excluding token cards generated by others.

The main focus of The Gatherer is the Potion. She has a potion Sack which can hold 3 "lesser" potions. The contents of the sack are gone at the end of each combat, so it's better to use them all. Especially when there are powers that care about using potions. There are other mechanics as well, like cards which care about unique cards, or cards with on-gain effects.

## Gameplay
Will add later

## Current State and Goal
GathererMod is currently at alpha. Any feedback is welcomed.

- Implemented Cards: 57/75
- Implemented Relics: 4/8
- Implemented Events: 0

All arts are not final, regardless of having BETA on its image or not. I'll try to make arts after finishing all the contents.

As a goal, The Gatherer will have similar quality as official characters. The power level of cards is going to be similar, though I can accept if she is a little bit weaker than other characters.
