(was 12(10))\n- Sealed Bomb damage increased 40(48) -> 50(60)\n- Feeling Fine Cost increased 0(0) -> 1(0)\n- Upgraded Feeling Fine no longer has Innate.\n- Black Tea Cost increased 1(0) -> 1(1)\n- Black Tea Strength decreased 4(4) -> 3(4)\n\nRelic Changes\n- Mist Generator now stops poison from decreasing when the enemy has 8 or less poison.
