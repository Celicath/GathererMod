  "description": "Adds The Gatherer as a new playable character with 75 cards, 5 relics.\r\n- Requires StSLib to run.\r\n\r\nv0.4.0\r\n- HP changed to 72 (was 64)\r\n- Changed name of cards to match the theme more.\r\n- Spare Bottle is removed from the starting deck, and is now Event-only.\r\n- Some cards have a <Tag> next to their name, which indicates they are different versions of same card. Tag difference matter for Uniqueness too.\r\n- Various balance changes.\r\n\r\n- For more information, visit\r\nhttps://github.com/Celicath/GathererMod/releases\r\n\r\nv0.3.1\r\n- Mining Stirke deals 1 more damage (partial revert)\r\n- Fixed bug where Scent of Rosmari was retaining cards for more than 1 turn.\r\n- Flower Power is now Uncommon.\r\n- Fixed Lucky Clover's wrong description.",
